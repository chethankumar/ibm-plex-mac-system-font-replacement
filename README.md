[IBM Plex](https://ibm.github.io/type/) is a new bespoke typeface from IBM.
Its designed to work really well on retina displays like Mac.

Using the [open source System font patcher](https://github.com/dtinth/YosemiteAndElCapitanSystemFontPatcher), I have patched the fonts that can be used readily.
